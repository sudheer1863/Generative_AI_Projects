# Generative AI Projects 🎨🤖  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **Generative AI projects** I’ve developed.  
Each project explores how AI can **create new content** — from text and images to audio and beyond.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each folder represents a **separate Generative AI project**.  
- Projects include:  
  - Text generation with Transformers (GPT, LLaMA, etc.)  
  - Image generation with GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models  
  - Style transfer for images and text  
  - Music/audio generation  
  - Prompt engineering experiments  
  - Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models  
  - Chatbots & creative assistants  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this repo is to:  
- Explore **state-of-the-art generative AI models**.  
- Showcase practical projects in **text, image, and multimedia generation**.  
- Experiment with **prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and creativity with AI**.  

## ⚠️ Note  
- All projects are built using **Python** with frameworks such as:  
  - `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow / Keras`  
  - `Hugging Face Transformers`  
  - `Diffusers`, `GAN libraries`  
- Some projects may require **GPU acceleration** for training and inference.  

## 💡 Contribution  
Contributions, ideas, or improvements are welcome!  
If you’d like to add new generative models or enhance existing ones, feel free to open a pull request.
