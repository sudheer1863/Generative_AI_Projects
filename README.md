# Generative AI Projects ✨🤖  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **Generative AI projects** I’ve developed.  
Each project focuses on building intelligent systems that can **generate text, images, code, or insights** using modern **LLMs and GenAI frameworks**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each folder represents a **separate Generative AI project**.  
- Projects typically include:  
  - Prompt engineering & prompt optimization  
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) usage  
  - Text generation, summarization, Q&A, and chatbots  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
  - Vector databases & embeddings  
  - Fine-tuning / parameter-efficient tuning (where applicable)  
  - API integration & application development  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The aim of this repo is to:  
- Apply **Generative AI concepts** to real-world use cases.  
- Showcase skills in **LLMs, prompt design, RAG, and AI-powered applications**.  
- Build end-to-end GenAI solutions that can be extended to production systems.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
Most projects are built using **Python** and modern GenAI tools such as:  
- `OpenAI / LLM APIs`  
- `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`  
- `Transformers (Hugging Face)`  
- `FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone` (Vector Databases)  
- `Streamlit / FastAPI` for UI & APIs  

## ⚠️ Note  
- Datasets, documents, or knowledge bases used are **public or custom-created**.  
- API keys and sensitive credentials are **never committed** to the repository.  
- Each project folder contains its own **README** with problem statement, approach, and usage steps.  

## 💡 Contribution  
Contributions are welcome!  
- Suggest new **GenAI project ideas**  
- Improve prompts, pipelines, or performance  
- Add support for new models or tools  

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
